# session-alive-simulator
A Python script with a GUI to simulate keyboard and mouse activity, helping to keep sessions alive and prevent inactivity timeouts.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- `pyautogui`
- `tkinter`

## Installation

To install the required libraries, use the following command:

```bash
pip install pyautogui
```
Note: tkinter is part of the Python standard library and should already be installed with your Python distribution.

## Usage
Run the script using Python:
```bash
python session_alive_simulator.py
```
For Windows users, you can also double-click the session_alive_simulator.pyw file to run the script without opening a console window.
A window will appear with "Start" and "Stop" buttons to control the simulation. Click "Start" to begin simulating mouse activity, and click "Stop" to end the simulation.

## Disclaimer
Using this script or any similar method to keep sessions alive might be against the terms of service of some applications. Be sure to review the terms and any applicable policies before using this script in a work environment.
